# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

	This web application is made for microgreen farmers. The web app should allow microgreen farmers to track their seed inventory, as well as allow them to manually put in orders they have received and auto track their planting schedule. Within their inventory farmers should be able to click on the seeds they have to know information about them such as the seed density, soaking, watering, days covered and uncovered that the seeds require, as well as what local suppliers they can purchase that type of seed from. 
	The farmer should be able to manually add, edit and delete items from their inventory. When they manually enter an order they have received it triggers a set of auto features such as adding to the calendar: planting dates, delivery dates and a daily schedule. Those seeds are also deleted from the farmers inventory. If time to add further capability the farmer will have a separate login option from their employees who will have access to less features.


### Features: List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description.

Inventory CRUD 
Farmer can create, update and delete inventory items
Order CRUD
Farmer can create, update and delete orders they have received 
Plant Schedule added to Calendar
When orders are received the calendar updates with a planting schedule and delivery dates and daily schedule 
*Potential 
User Login–role based access
Admin (farmer) gets access to all features through their login
Employee gets access to calendar feature through their login
5)	Customer CRUD
Farmer can create, update and delete customers




### Technologies: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application?

UI-Front End creation using REACT framework and Javascript 
API-Back End using Java, Spring, SQL


### What I'll Have to Learn: In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.

We will need to learn how to use REACT framework on the front end to make our web app. We will also need to learn how to connect our front end UI to the back end API that we have created. 
The calendar feature is also a new problem we will need to solve.
